My greatest barriers to cooking something nice are (1) having the right
ingredients and (2) knowing what to cook.

To solve these problems I'm using this page as a record of a few tasty and easy
things I can cook with straight to the point directions that don't digress into
small details.

### Sausage and Veggies

- Sausage

Cut everything and put it in an open pan in the oven with some olive oil on top. Done.<br>

### Pesto Chicken

- Chicken

<span class="recipe-label">10 minutes</span><br>
Season the chicken, arrange is as in the picture. Put in the oven.<br>
Searing the chicken beforehand seems to make it even nicer.<br>
This could be the full meal, but it's better served with purée or salad.

### Pizza
