Maybe one day I will start posting status updates in this website. Maybe every week, maybe not. A weak commitment.

The idea is to follow the concept of [POSE](https://indieweb.org/POSE) where you "Publish Once Syndicate Everywhere".
Let's see if I will go through with it.

For now here is a picture of London from above I took on my return flight from Gibraltar.
It is the clearest view of the city I've had in an airplane.
This was also the hottest day the UK ever had.
