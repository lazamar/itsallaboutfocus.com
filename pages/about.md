I'm Marcelo Lazaroni, I live in London and work with computers.

I was born in Brazil and started this blog at the ripe age of 20 in 2012 while living in Buenos Aires. It was initially an exercise to improve my English in preparation for my move to London to study computer science. Since then it has evolved into a place where I document my thoughts on particular subjects.

This blog has served me as a great way to keep track of how my views changed through the years.
It must be said that I agree with very little of my older posts, in both their form and content.

I also write about tech stuff on [https://lazamar.github.io/](https://lazamar.github.io/)
